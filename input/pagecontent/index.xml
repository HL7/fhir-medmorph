  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    The Making EHR Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) project seeks to advance public health and patient-centered outcomes 
    by using emerging health data and exchange standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and 
    Clinical Quality Language (CQL), to develop and implement an interoperable solution that will enable access to clinical data. 
    The MedMorph project fits within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strategic imperative of transforming how data are collected, 
    used, and shared through modern Information Technology (IT) capabilities to save lives and improve health.  
    The MedMorph project is funded by the Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) 
    Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and executed by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) Public Health Informatics Office (PHIO) 
    to advance research and public health goals.
    </p>
    <p>
	The project aims to leverage the maturation of standards and requirements for certification of health information technology by the 
	Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) that underpin many EHRs. 
	Examples such as FHIR, the ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), 
	2015 Edition Cures Update - United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 1, February 2020 and 
	standardized application programming interfaces (API) for patient services have created a health IT environment that is 
	ripe for developing standards-based scalable and extensible solutions to overcome interoperability challenges. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The MedMorph project will use three fully modeled use cases across three distinct areas that are representative of broader areas of research and public health: Chronic Hepatitis C (Hep C) Surveillance, 
    an infectious disease; Cancer Registry Reporting, a chronic disease; and Health Care Surveys, pertaining to health care utilization and not a specific condition. These three use cases inform the design of a scalable and extensible reference architecture 
    to facilitate data exchange for key patient-centered research questions and public health information system requirements.
    For more detailed explanation on the reference architecture refer to next paragraph and the <a href="background.html">Implementation Guide Overview</a> section.

<h3>Reference Architecture Overview</h3>
	<p>
	The MedMorph Implementation Guide presented here is also known as the MedMorph Reference Architecture (RA) Implementation Guide (IG). 
	Reference Architecture refers to a common framework (e.g., Actors, Systems, FHIR resources, FHIR APIs, FHIR operations, security mechanisms) that will be leveraged by multiple public health and research use cases.
	The Medmorph RA IG is accompanied by what are called as Content IGs. These content IGs provide specific content profiles that are to be used for a specific use case.
	Requirements for specific use cases will be driven by the Content IGs where as the requirements for the framework components such as a Backend Services App, Knowledge Artifact Repository, TTP etc are identified in the MedMorph RA.
	There are example capability statements created for actors whose specific requirements will be identified in the Content IGs.   
	</p>
	<p>Examples of Content IGs include <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/central-cancer-registry-reporting/2022Jan/">Central Cancer Registry Reporting IG</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/health-care-surveys-reporting/2022Jan/">Health Care Survey Reporting IG</a>.
	The relationship between these IGs are further explained in the <a href="background.html#implementation-guides-types-and-their-relationships">IG Relationships section</a> section.
	An overview of these actors, systems and interactions are explained further in the <a href="usecases.html#medmorph-actors-and-definitions"><b>MedMorph Actors and Systems</b></a> section and a thumbnail is provided below for reference.
